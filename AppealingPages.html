<h1>Zillow</h1>

    <li>When going on Zillow, you are typically looking to rent an apartment or look to buy a house! <br>
    You immediately are presented with the options to search for rentals or a property for sale, or you could look for both
    and begin searching in an area!</li>
    <li>When I was apartment hunting, I loved the fact I could look for EXACTLY what I needed. <br>
    I was able to search for the number of rooms, bathrooms, and price that my roommates and I needed.<br>
    After filtering those, you get results on the map on the left and on the right you can see photos of the homes!</li>
    <li>After selecting the home you're interested in, you are given the contact information for the realtor <br>
    and depending on the home, you can even do the full purchase over the Zillow app. The UX as a whole I feel is very smooth.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would definitely recommend others use Zillow for their rental and purchasing needs. At least as a start,<br>
it makes for a great place to get an idea of pricing, taxes, and the location you are looking to move!</p>

<h1>Apple</h1>
<br>
<h1>URL</h1><a href="https://www.apple.com/">https://www.apple.com/</a>
<br>
<br>

<img src="Apple.png" align="center" width="360" height="197.25">
<ol>
    <li>When shopping on Apple's site, you are typically looking to purchase a new piece of technology for your day-to-day needs.<br>
        On the top menu, you are presented with essentially all of their flagship products which is what you are typically shopping for.</li>
    <li>I purchased a Macbook from Apple this past year, and it was incredibly easy to purchase new, and trade in my old Macbook Pro.<br>
        The site takes in the serial number of the old one, provides the value and applies it to the new one. They ship you the new,<br>
        you ship them the old, and the value gets applied. Incredibly simple for no in-store purchase.</li>
    <li>I feel the site is very visually appealing as a whole. You can see the specs of devices on their respective home pages, <br>
        yet, they are not thrown at you in a way that is hard to understand. They make each tile relevant to the page you are on,<br>
        and with no ads, it makes for a very clean experience that you would hope for when you pay the cost Apple charges for devices.</li>
</ol>
<p>Would I recommend shopping on Apple's website, if you are an Apple consumer already, yes definitely! The experience is easy to say the least.<br>
    Now for someone who doesn't necessarily have any Apple products, I would say certain products are fine to exist on their own, but with an iPhone,<br>
    you truly get fully engulfed in the Apple Ecosystem for sure.</p>
