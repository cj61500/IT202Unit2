    <li>From what seems to be a Norwegian Ebay almost, there is no flow to the site at all.</li>
    <li>There are two different menu bars that look to serve the same purpose, on separate parts of the screen.</li>
    <li>The contact details for some reason are in the middle of the page, in between all the listings.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Recommendations for improvement</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Definitely remove the fact that the page scrolls to both the right and down. This would help solve the organization.</li>
    <li>Now that the page ONLY scrolls down, we can move the second menu, to below the first, making one continuous menu.</li>
    <li>Adjust the way the products are displayed. Only show a certain amount at once and show only similarly related products in groups.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would definitely not recommend this site as 1 I'm sure you can find any of this on Amazon, and 2 I'm not too sure they ship internationally!</p>

<h2>This page is unappealing because..</h2>
<img src="MGBD.png" align="center" width="360" height="197.25">
<ol>
    <li>WE GET IT, IT'S ABOUT CARS! We don't need to have a photo of a car or car parts,<br>
    behind text on the page or in menus.</li>
    <li>The parts shop is on an entirely different page than this making me feel as if this main webpage,<br>
    is entirely useless.</li>
    <li>For some reason, they have the names of the parts they sell listed on the homepage. Typically,<br>
    this is not a knock, but I feel as if for a business selling car parts, unless you're linking me to that part,<br>
    I don't need to know the parts, I need to find the part I need.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Recommendations for improvement</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The site is infinitely better if they remove the current "theme" and remove photo's that are unnecessary.</li>
    <li>Now that the page ONLY scrolls down, we can move the second menu, to below the first, making one continuous menu.</li>
    <li>I would say adjusting the menu on the left side of the page would do a massive deal of help to the overall look.
    <br> Using submenus within the menus to create a shorter list would be great.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would probably not recommend this site as I would recommend using Auto Tempest to go purchase a new car instead!</p>
